# Predicting-Dengue-Philippines

This repository contains all the files that I use in writing my research "Predicting dengue in the Philippines using artificial neural network."

The raw datasets are included in this repository.

Each administrative region in the Philippines has its own python notebook, which means they have their own predictive models based on the humidity, rainfall, and temperature.
